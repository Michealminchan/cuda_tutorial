# Objective

Use the Thrust template library to perform a reduction of a 1D list of 32-bit floats. The reduction should give the sum of the list. Your code should be able to handle lists of arbitrary length, but for brevity assume that all data will fit within the GPU global memory.

# Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, make sure that:

- You have completed week 4 lecture videos

# Instruction

Edit the code in the code tab to perform the following:

Instructions about where to place each part of the code is demarcated by the `//@@` comment lines.
